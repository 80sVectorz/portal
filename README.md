# Portal
Portal is a tool that lets you navigate directories quickly and in style.

## But what does this mean?
Well I'll give an example. Let's say that you have multiple projects or your computer is too organized with a lot of sub directories that you don't want to type in when switching directories/workspaces. 
With portal you can easily switch between directories. An easy example of the process would be the `/bin/portal_bin` directory. So you navigate there using `cd`.
Then you use the portal make command (`portal -m portal_bin`) and now you can easily go there whenever you want using `portal to portal_bin`.
